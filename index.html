    <h1>Review</h1>
    <h2 class="heading">"Public Announcement"</h2>
    <div><p>I remember this song when it was released as a single. It’s interesting hearing it on this project. 
    <br>
    <br>
        It’s a flex song, as evidenced by Cheeky Banter’s announcement, in his own voice, that he’d like to introduce to the “ladies and gentlemen” of his audience “Atlanta’s finest finesser, Atlanta’s finest engineer, Atlanta’s finest producer...Cheeky Banter.” The flex continues as Cheeky Banter further delineates exactly who the “public announcement” is for—all Atlanta artists. 
    <br>
    <br>
        The song, in part, is about how he’ll make money off of his craft “chef-ing up hits.” I struggled to understand how announcing to Atlanta artists his intentions to “make money off of this” fits in with the rest of the album given that this body of work largely deals with Cheeky’s (sometimes) true stories about past personal traumas, but the hook is definitely catchy and there are some great verses in the song. It isn’t until Verse 2 that I understand how the content of “Public Announcement” and the songs that follow fit together as a collection. 
    <br>
    <br>
        Verse 2 provides a hint of Cheeky Banter’s trademark boyish vulnerability, as well as a preview of what listeners can expect for the rest of the album. Followed by a recording from his “Gran-T,” Cheeky Banter raps about some tips some “OGs” gave him, tips that now rest in his “back pocket.” The OGs tell him, “You’d better get focused on money, Lil Homie. You’d better watch out for them hoes, Lil Homie. You scared, go to church, you’ll be safe Lil Homie. Better sit down, learn your place, Lil Homie.” Given that the rest of the album deals with the dangers, difficulties, and lessons typical to the urban, Black male, coming-of-age experience, this advice from the OGs serves as both a stern warning and prophetic foreshadow of things to come.  
    <br>
    <br>
        The arrangement of the production elements is really good. The song is catchy and the tone feels triumphant. My favorite lines in the song are “Whipping it up in the kitchen, I’m chef-ing up hits/Just look at the flick of the wrist/I’ve been killing this slit wrist with that pen game[…].” The bit about “killing this slit wrist,” in particular, is clever and was a pleasant surprise. I’ve listened to this song many times, mostly when the song was first debuted as a single, and I only just today noticed that line.  
    </div></p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="heading">"Trust Issues"</h2>
    <div><p>“Trust Issues” is a pretty straight-forward song. It is about how, from Cheeky’s perspective, the people in his life “think that they’re worth” his time but leave him with “scars on [his] back from the knives [they’ve] inserted.” The analogy explains how people, whose friendship he has given time and effort into nurturing, have betrayed him in some way or another. The evidence of these betrayals are the visible scars he wears on his skin. The song explores how, ultimately, no one should be trusted. This is a song from the perspective of someone who seems to have given others the opportunity to prove themselves worthy of trust, but has found through experience, counsel, and scripture the futility of such an effort. 
    <br>
    <br>
        There is a small nuance in Verse 2 that troubles the overarching message of the song. In Verse 2, Cheeky raps, “A pledge of allegiance to all of the real ones/The ones that are militant, move as a unit and […].” This seems to reveal that perhaps not everyone whose character Cheeky has scrutinized has come up short. However, this short reprieve from Cheeky’s scathing examination of people quickly ends as he recounts how his “Pops” and the Bible taught him to “test all things.” The result of this “test[ing] all things” lands Cheeky back where he started at the beginning of the song—distrustful, and as repeated in a loop in the hook, with “trust issues.” 
    <br>
    <br>
        It’s interesting to note that Cheeky’s conclusion not to trust anyone is bound with the concept of his individualism. He raps towards the end of Verse 2, “That means I’m not supposed to trust nobody. That’s fine by me. That means I can just keep on being me.” If not trusting anyone “means [he] can just keep on being [himself],” does trusting someone mean that some part of the self is lost somewhere in the shuffle? Or does the line simply imply that without the intrusion of others in one’s life—something that would come with keeping people at arm’s length—one doesn’t have to be bothered with focusing on anyone but oneself? It’s an interesting line to mull over. 
    <br>
    <br>
        My favorite line from this song is “A moment of silence for the ones that I cut off/I wish I could keep you around, but I cannot.” I could write about some of the production elements that I find intriguing, but I fear I’m writing too much as it is.
